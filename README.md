# Collatz Conjecture

## Overview

The Collatz Conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics, also known as the 3n + 1 conjecture. It is named after the German mathematician Lothar Collatz, who first proposed it in 1937. The conjecture involves a simple iterative process that is deceptively difficult to analyze.

## The Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture can be described with the following algorithm:

1. Take any positive integer `n`.
2. If `n` is even, divide it by 2.
3. If `n` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
4. Repeat the process with the resulting number.

The conjecture asserts that no matter what positive integer you start with, you will eventually reach the number 1. Once at 1, the sequence will enter a loop: 1 → 4 → 2 → 1.

## History

- **1937**: Lothar Collatz first proposed the conjecture. It was initially part of his work on number theory and dynamic systems.
- **1960s**: The conjecture gained more attention as computational experiments confirmed its validity for a large range of numbers.
- **1970s-1980s**: Mathematicians and computer scientists performed extensive numerical checks, verifying the conjecture for numbers up to 2^60.
- **2000s**: Despite numerous attempts, the conjecture remains unproven, and it has become a classic example of how simple rules can lead to complex and unpredictable behavior.

## Current Status

The Collatz Conjecture remains one of the unsolved problems in mathematics. It has been tested for very large numbers using computational methods, and no counterexamples have been found. However, a formal proof or disproof of the conjecture has yet to be discovered.

## Significance

The Collatz Conjecture is notable for several reasons:

- **Simplicity and Complexity**: The conjecture is easy to state and understand, yet it leads to complex behavior that is challenging to analyze rigorously.
- **Mathematical Interest**: It connects to various areas of mathematics, including number theory, dynamical systems, and probability theory.
- **Computational Challenge**: The conjecture has been used as a test case for computational methods and algorithms, demonstrating the power and limitations of current computational techniques.
